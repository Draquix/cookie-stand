            <p>With the rich hearty flavor of salmon, and that cruncy wonderful texture of everybody's favorite snack, cookies, our Salmon Cookies are bound to hit 
                the spot. Our well trained staff is happy to meet your fish flavored cookie needs.  Don't like salmon?  Maybe try our Tuna or Clam cookies instead.
            </p>
            <p>It all started by the most amazing chance happening...  Pat had been camping by a river on a weekend fishing get-away. The night before he had caught
                one of the largest salmon he'd ever managed to catch... and as he roasted that fish on a stick over his campfire for breakfast, the string he had tied 
                it to the stick with burnt through and the fish fell into the fire.  Pat rushed to his tent to retrieve the set of tongs he always had there
                but by the time he got back to the fire and retrieved his beautiful salmon it was mostly burnt to a crisp.  There was only enough meat to make 
                a sandwich.  Pat dug around in his bag but he'd forgotten the bread at home.  But there were two cookies his 
                mother had packed for him.  It gave him an idea... That was the best fish cookie sandwich he'd ever had up to that point
                and now he's bringing it to you.
