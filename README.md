## Week Two Project- The Salmon Cookies

This is a website for a fictional business selling salmon flavored cookies. It has
a primary index page that is meant to look as if it's a real business' web page. 
On the sales page, the JavaScript is focused on creating objects that represent
each location for the business. Some of the sales data was specified in giving us
the assignment, and based on that we wrote a function that generates a random 
figure to represent customers coming in. A set of data is produced using methods
of the objects and displayed on the HTML page.

## Projected Changes
* In lab 07 we will switch to a single object constructor function rather than declaring seperate object literals as done here
* Instead of writing list items and appending them to the page, we will learn about tables and adapt the page to display tables
